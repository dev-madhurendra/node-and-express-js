The key difference between the asynchronous and synchronous file operations (`readFile` vs `readFileSync`, `writeFile` vs `writeFileSync`, etc.) in Node.js applies to all file system methods:

### Asynchronous Methods (e.g., `readFile`, `writeFile`)
- **Non-blocking**: Asynchronous operations do not block the execution of subsequent code. The program can continue executing while the file operation happens in the background.
- **Callback/Promise-based**: They require a callback function or use Promises to handle the results (success or error) of the operation.
- **Example** (Asynchronous `writeFile` and `readFile`):
  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');

  // Write file asynchronously
  fs.writeFile('example.txt', 'Hello World!', (err) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log('File written asynchronously');

    // Read file asynchronously
    fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log('File content:', data);
    });
  });
  ```

### Synchronous Methods (e.g., `readFileSync`, `writeFileSync`)
- **Blocking**: Synchronous operations block the execution of the code until the operation is complete. The code waits for the file operation to finish before continuing to the next instruction.
- **Simpler control flow**: Since execution is paused until the operation is done, synchronous methods are easier to understand but can slow down performance if used in scenarios requiring concurrency.
- **Example** (Synchronous `writeFileSync` and `readFileSync`):
  ```javascript
  const fs = require('fs');

  // Write file synchronously
  fs.writeFileSync('example.txt', 'Hello World!');
  console.log('File written synchronously');

  // Read file synchronously
  const data = fs.readFileSync('example.txt', 'utf8');
  console.log('File content:', data);
  ```

### Key Differences:
- **Asynchronous methods** (`writeFile`, `readFile`, etc.): Non-blocking, rely on callbacks or Promises.
- **Synchronous methods** (`writeFileSync`, `readFileSync`, etc.): Blocking, halts the execution until the operation completes.
